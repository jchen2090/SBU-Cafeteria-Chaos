# Cafeteria Chaos 

Students are hungry, and the cafeteria is in chaos! Step into the shoes of a fast-paced campus chef trying to feed the never-ending line of students before the lunch bell rings. Take orders, cook delicious meals, and serve them up fast.

This project is currently on display at Stony Brook University (West Side Dining)
